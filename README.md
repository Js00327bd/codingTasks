# codingTasks
# in the task we will be doing Explatory Data analysis on the Titanic data set
# fistly we will import all the library we will be using
# after importing all the library we will read the titanic csv file on the jupyter notebook
# we will use head, describe and info function to understand the data 
# we will check the null value if there is null value then we will clean the data 
# using count plot we will try to undertand the data 
# using boxplot we will try to understand the independanat and dependant variable 
# removing the null value from the feature variable
# creating heatmap to undertand the feature variable effect on the data
# will drop some data which we think not require for analysis
# will check the data  again after cleaning 
# will do a pairplot to understand teh realtion betweek dependant and independant variable


# Exploratory data analysis is the most important aspect of the all analysis, most of the time the data we get for analysis is not prepared so before starting analysing the data we need to understnad the data and do cleaning so that we can get a clean data to work with. clean data means the information will be cleana and anlysing would be much better. the best practice for any data analysing is to have clean data and data visualisation gets help from the celan data, later on when we use this data for the machine learning models we will get better outcomes and prediction.
